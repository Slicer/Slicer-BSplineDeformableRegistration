BSpline Deformable Registration - An Awesome Project
====================================================

This module is _NOT_ actively supported or maintained (See [#3401](http://na-mic.org/Mantis/view.php?id=3401)).
The associated code has been copied from Slicer [r23589](http://viewvc.slicer.org/viewvc.cgi/Slicer4?view=revision&revision=23589)

Note that the code is expected to compile against Slicer 4.4. That said, 
the BSplineDeformableRegistration/CMakeLists.txt will have to be tweaked to ensure tests pass.
